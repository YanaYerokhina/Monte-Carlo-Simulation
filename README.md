# Monte Carlo Simulation Project

## Overview
This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to model and analyze probabilistic scenarios. Monte Carlo methods rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, making them useful for solving problems that might be deterministic in principle but are computationally complex.

## Features
- Simulates a given problem using Monte Carlo methods
- Uses random sampling to approximate mathematical and physical systems
- Configurable parameters for number of iterations and probability distributions
- Outputs statistical analysis and visualizations

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You will also need the following libraries:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YanaYerokhina/Monte-Carlo-Simulation.git
   cd Monte-Carlo-Simulation
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python monte_carlo.py
   ```
3. Adjust the parameters in `monte_carlo.py` to experiment with different simulations.

## Example Output
- Estimated value of Pi using Monte Carlo simulation
- Probability distributions of sampled data
- Graphical representations of results
